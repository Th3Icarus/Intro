        Mauschbaugh Intro



        I am a digital storytelling major who took Intro to Web Design over the summer, and spent the whole time in Arizona. 
        I currently live both in Columbia and Tempe (AZ), and go back and forth between the two. I'm from southwest Missouri (Springfield) 
        and am currently in my last year of college at the University of Missouri in Columbia.
        I'm not sure what I hope to gain from this course, other than, possibly, some addendum 
        to what I learned in my web design class. I'm also hopeful that this helps with my career later on.
